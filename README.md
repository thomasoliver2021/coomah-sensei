# クマー先生

クマー先生 (Coomah Sensei) is a conversational AI meant for beginners to the Japanese language!
Currently this is up to allow for users to test and help me train it, because I could only think of so many different conversations.

If you'd like to help with training, go here!: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GozJJuc_kzvor7-_x7hFzFwmV6Gsfrdc?usp=sharing)

Created logs can be sent to me via Discord if you have it, or emailed to coomahsensei@gmail.com

ありがおうございます！
