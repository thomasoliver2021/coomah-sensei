# クマー先生

クマー先生 (Coomah Sensei) is a conversational AI meant for beginners to the Japanese language!
Currently this is up to allow for users to test and help me train it, because I could only think of so many different conversations.

While training, please keep in mind that クマー先生 does not know all the vocab in the Japanese language! A list of vocab it should theoretically know is in the repo, titled "vocab.txt". Using vocab not in this list can confuse it. So can using vocab in this list. It's still learning!

For instructions on how to help train, please refer to this [video](https://youtu.be/ejZxaUEOC_A)!

Created logs can be sent to me via Discord if you have it, or emailed to coomahsensei@gmail.com

ありがおうございます！
